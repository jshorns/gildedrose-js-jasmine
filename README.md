# Gilded rose tech test

- I have completed the js-jasmine version of this kata. next up; ruby!

## My approach - JS-JASMINE

- I began by writing a full suite of jasmine tests. In the interests of testing behaviour, my tests all follow the same format, of testing the output of updateQuality against its input. However, I grouped the tests according to the type of item - this would enable me to identify which bit of the logic had gone wrong as I refactored.
- I then changed the for loop to 'for x of y' format, to make the code easier to read, and changed the increments and decrements to ++ and -- operators to streamline the code and make it less verbose.
- Since the Sulfuras hand never changes, I then introduced a guard condition where the loop skips to the next iteration if the itme is a hand. This saves the hand from being cycled through any further logic.
- I then added a line to decrement the sellIn, since this is universal across all items other than the hand.
- I then tried to add a guard condition for maximum quality. However, this didn't work for cases where quality increased doubly (e.g. aged brie after sell-by date) because the quality would reach 51. At this point I decided it would make sense to write different functions for each kind of item - the only job of the updateQuality function would thus be to ascertain the type of item and then call the appropriate function, skipping to the next iteration once this had been done.
- I followed this process for all item types, and in doing so discovered a bug where I hadn't written my tests for the Sulfuras hands properly, and had made the mistake of using 'return' rather than 'continue' in the function. This was fixed.
- to maximise DRY I moved increasing and decreasing quality into their own functions. as well.
- I then wrote a test suite for Conjured items. I assumed that these would be like normal items, but with 'Conjured' as a prefix to the name.
- With these tests failing, I wrote a conjuredItems function that simply called the normalItems function twice. Initially I did not have this in a for iteration loop, as it seemed excessive when it was only happening twice. However, I then realised that the code would be much easier to change using a for loop (if conjured items suddenly needed to age 7 times as fast as normal items, only a single digit would need to be changed), so I moved this into a for loop.
- Also to make the code easy to change, I made min and max quality into properties of the Shop class. This way they could very easily be adjusted if needed and would only needed to be changed in one part of the code.
- Finally, for thoroughness I added a test suite for the full range of items as provided in the text tests.
- **What I would have done differently** - as I was refactoring rather than changing functionality, and my existing tests tested behaviour as needed, I did not write unit tests for the individual functions for each item group, as I felt my programming could be driven by the tests I already had. Retrospectively I would have added the extra tests, as it would have made it easier to identify the behaviour of the functions themselves.

## Kata details

This is a well known kata developed by Terry Hughes. This is commonly used as a tech test to assess a candidate's ability to read, refactor and extend legacy code.

Here is the text of the kata:

\*"Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city run by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new category of items. First an introduction to our system:

All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item. All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is. At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item. Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
The Quality of an item is never negative
“Aged Brie” actually increases in Quality the older it gets
The Quality of an item is never more than 50
“Sulfuras”, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
“Backstage passes”, like aged brie, increases in Quality as it’s SellIn value approaches; Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality drops to 0 after the concert
We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:

“Conjured” items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items
Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and add any new code as long as everything still works correctly. However, do not alter the Item class or Items property as those belong to the goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn’t believe in shared code ownership (you can make the UpdateQuality method and Items property static if you like, we’ll cover for you)."\*

# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/).

I translated the original C# into a few other languages, (with a little help from my friends!), and slightly changed the starting position. This means I've actually done a small amount of refactoring already compared with the original form of the kata, and made it easier to get going with writing tests by giving you one failing unit test to start with. I also added test fixtures for Text-Based approval testing with TextTest (see [the TextTests](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/texttests))

As Bobby Johnson points out in his article ["Why Most Solutions to Gilded Rose Miss The Bigger Picture"](http://iamnotmyself.com/2012/12/07/why-most-solutions-to-gilded-rose-miss-the-bigger-picture), it'll actually give you
better practice at handling a legacy code situation if you do this Kata in the original C#. However, I think this kata
is also really useful for practicing writing good tests using different frameworks and approaches, and the small changes I've made help with that. I think it's also interesting to compare what the refactored code and tests look like in different programming languages.

I use this kata as part of my work as a technical coach. I wrote a lot about the coaching method I use in this book [Technical Agile Coaching with the Samman method](https://leanpub.com/techagilecoach). A while back I wrote this article ["Writing Good Tests for the Gilded Rose Kata"](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/03/writing-good-tests-for-the-gilded-rose-kata/) about how you could use this kata in a [coding dojo](https://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook).

## How to use this Kata

The simplest way is to just clone the code and start hacking away improving the design. You'll want to look at the ["Gilded Rose Requirements"](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt) which explains what the code is for. I strongly advise you that you'll also need some tests if you want to make sure you don't break the code while you refactor.

You could write some unit tests yourself, using the requirements to identify suitable test cases. I've provided a failing unit test in a popular test framework as a starting point for most languages.

Alternatively, use the "Text-Based" tests provided in this repository. (Read more about that in the next section)

Whichever testing approach you choose, the idea of the exercise is to do some deliberate practice, and improve your skills at designing test cases and refactoring. The idea is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice designing tests, taking small steps, running the tests often, and incrementally improving the design.

## Text-Based Approval Testing

This code comes with comprehensive tests that use this approach. For information about how to run them, see the [texttests README](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/texttests)

## Translating this code

More translations are most welcome! I'm very open for pull requests that translate the starting position into additional languages.

Please note a translation should ideally include:

- a translation of the production code for 'update_quality' and Item
- one failing unit test complaining that "fixme" != "foo"
- a TextTest fixture, ie a command-line program that runs update_quality on the sample data for the number of days specified.

Please don't write too much code in the starting position or add too many unit tests. The idea with the one failing unit test is to tempt people to work out how to fix it, discover it wasn't that hard, and now they understand what this test is doing they realize they can improve it.

If your programming language doesn't have an easy way to add a command-line interface, then the TextTest fixture is probably not necessary.

## Better Code Hub

I analysed this repo according to the clean code standards on [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) just to get an independent opinion of how bad the code is. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the compliance score is low!
